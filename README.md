## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo to your working directory:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ivodolenc/nuxt-locomotive.git <project-name>
```

2. Move to the project directory:

```sh
$ cd <project-name>
```

3. Install all dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn # or npm install
```

## Build Setup

Start the local `dev` server:

```sh
$ yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

## Static Deployment

Nuxt.js will create a `dist/` directory with everything inside ready to be deployed on a static hosting service.

Generate your static application:

```sh
$ yarn generate # or npm run generate
```

Once your application is built you can use the `start` command to see a production version of your application.

Serve the generated static application from a `dist/` directory:

```sh
$ yarn start # or npm run start
```

This is useful for final testing before deploying.
